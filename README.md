// EXERCISE

/* You have three categories of books: horror, action, romance.

The idea is to create a table of books, with a search input.

If you write something at the input, it will filter the table.

You can add, edit, modify books.


** Create a book class which will have a "Category" attribute. 
** Treat them as the same object.
